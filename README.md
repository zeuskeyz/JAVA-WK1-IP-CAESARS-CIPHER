## JAVA CAESAR'S CIPHER PROGRAM
************************

#### Creating a Ceaser Cipher program using Java programming Language 


#### By: **Sailas O. Hezron**
#### Date: **17th April 2023**   

### DESCRIPTION
The code implements a Caesar cipher, both encoding, and decoding on user input messages using a key. The key is an integer from 1 to 25.
A Caesar cipher is a type of substitution in which each letter is shifted a certain number of places also known as a key, down the alphabet.  
For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.

## BDD
* After running the code, Select the process,
  - Input "E" or "ENCODE" for encoding and "D" or "DECODING" for decoding
  - If any the input doesnt match the above an error will be populated.
  - 

* The user will get a prompt to enter their message
  - Input a text to decode or encode


* The user will receive a prompt to enter the Key
  - The key number between 1 and 25. 
  - If a number out of this bounds is entered an error will be populated.


* Once the encoded or decoded results are displayed or an error is populated a user will get the propmt to continue or terminate
  - Input "C" or "CONTINUE" to keep going
  - Input "Q" or "QUIT" to terminate the process. 
  - A notification appears if the process is terminated.
  - The code restarts if the user opts to continue
